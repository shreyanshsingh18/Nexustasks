- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the values.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Ensure you have a valid `MONGODB_URI`.

4. Start the development server:
